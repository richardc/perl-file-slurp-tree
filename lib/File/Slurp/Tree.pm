=head1 NAME

File::Slurp::Tree - slurp and emit file trees as nested hashes

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 # (inefficiently) duplicate a file tree from path a to b
 use File::Slurp::Tree;
 my $tree = slurp_tree( "path_a" );
 spew_tree( "path_b" => $tree );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

File::Slurp::Tree provides functions for slurping and emitting trees
of files and directories.

 # an example of use in a test suite
 use Test::More tests => 1;
 use File::Slurp::Tree;
 is_deeply( slurp_tree( "t/some_path" ), { foo => {}, bar => "sample\n" },
            "some_path contains a directory called foo, and a file bar" );

The tree datastructure is a hash of hashes.  The keys of each hash are
names of directories or files.  Directories have hash references as
their value, files have a scalar which holds the contents of the file.

=head1 EXPORTED ROUTINES

=head2 slurp_tree( $path, %options )

return a nested hash reference containing everything within $path

%options may include the following keys:

=over

=item rule

a L<File::Find::Rule> object that will match the files and directories
in the path.  defaults to an empty rule (matches everything)

Creates a file tree as described by C<$tree> at C<$path>
